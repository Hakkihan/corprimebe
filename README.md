# Data WebSocket Gateway

![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/nestjs/nest/master?token=abc123def456)

## Overview

This project is a WebSocket-based application built using **NestJS** and **Socket.IO**. It allows clients to subscribe to real-time data streams for random numbers and Bitcoin prices, with updates sent at regular intervals.

### Features:
- **Real-time random number generation**: Clients can subscribe to receive random numbers at regular intervals.
- **Bitcoin price updates**: Clients can subscribe to receive live Bitcoin price data fetched from an external API.
- **WebSocket communication**: The app uses WebSocket to deliver real-time updates to subscribed clients.

### Architecture:
- **Gateway**: Handles WebSocket connections and messages between clients and the backend.
- **Service**: Contains the logic for generating random numbers and fetching Bitcoin price data.
- **Model**: Manages the data and interactions with external APIs or databases.

## Technologies
- **NestJS**: A framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
- **Socket.IO**: A library for real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and client.
- **RxJS**: Used for reactive programming and managing streams of data.
- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and better development experience.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn**

### Steps to Run Locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repository-name
npm install
# or
yarn install
Configure Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root of the project and configure the necessary environment variables. Example .env file:

plaintext
Copy code
COINGECKO_URL=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3
SOCKET_PORT=3000
Run the Application: Start the NestJS server in development mode:

bash
Copy code
npm run start:dev
# or
yarn start:dev
The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Test the WebSocket Connection:

Open a WebSocket client or browser console and connect to the WebSocket server at ws://localhost:3000/data.
Subscribe to the random number stream:
js
Copy code
socket.emit('subscribeRandomNumber');
socket.on('randomNumber', (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
Subscribe to the Bitcoin price stream:
js
Copy code
socket.emit('subscribeBitcoinPrice');
socket.on('bitcoinPrice', (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
Deployment
You can deploy this application to a cloud service like Heroku, AWS, Vercel, or DigitalOcean.

Deployment Steps:
Set up environment variables on your cloud provider. This includes API URLs and any other secrets you need.

Deploy:

For Heroku:
Push the project to your GitHub repository.
Connect your GitHub repository to Heroku, and deploy the application.
For AWS:
Use AWS Lambda or EC2, and configure environment variables and the WebSocket service accordingly.
For Vercel or Netlify:
These platforms provide automated deployment from GitHub repositories. Set the appropriate environment variables in the platformâ€™s dashboard.
Production Configuration:
CORS: In the production environment, ensure that your WebSocket server has the correct CORS settings to allow communication between the client and server.
WebSocket Events
The WebSocket server supports the following events:

subscribeRandomNumber: Client subscribes to the random number stream.
subscribeBitcoinPrice: Client subscribes to the Bitcoin price stream.
unsubscribeRandomNumber: Client unsubscribes from the random number stream.
unsubscribeBitcoinPrice: Client unsubscribes from the Bitcoin price stream.
Notes
Error Handling: In case of errors (e.g., network issues), the server will log messages and continue providing the last known data.
Scalability: This architecture can be scaled horizontally to handle more clients by using Redis or other message brokers for Pub/Sub functionality.
